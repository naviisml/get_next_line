# get_next_line

The get_next_line project is aimed to teach you how to work with static variables. The subject is to make a function that reads the next line of a file, based on a buffer size defined during compilation using the flag `-D BUFFER_SIZE=<amount>`. If there is no new line, or if the function fails, the function will return (NULL).
